### What is a Smart City?
A smart city is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information used to manage assets and resources efficiently. This includes data collected from citizens, devices, and assets that is processed and analyzed to monitor and manage traffic and transportation systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, information systems, schools, libraries, hospitals, and other community services.

The smart city concept integrates information and communication technology (ICT), and various physical devices connected to the network (the Internet of things or IoT) to optimize the efficiency of city operations and services and connect to citizens. Smart city technology allows city officials to interact directly with both community and city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city and how the city is evolving.

### Why do we need it?
The outcome of our centuries-old model of city growth is skyrocketing inequality. We’re now in a situation wherein we continue to build cities that are net contributors to the very problems we seek to solve. Our cities get bigger, commute times get longer, the impact on our environment gets worse. What do we do? We build bigger roads and provide services further away from where people live and don’t take cogent environmental action.

This is a global challenge. Examples in China, India, Africa and here in America vividly illustrate the need for smarter solutions to deal with massive population growth, rural to urban migration, and resource depletion.

We need to transform our cities. Not just once, but continuously.

An unstoppable process of effortless and endless reinvention must be set in motion. Technology enables reinvention. Exciting solutions are beginning to emerge from R&D in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and nano- and bio-technologies. Science too, is generating insights – revealing unforeseen problems and opportunities. Evolving models for innovation and entrepreneurship are ensuring more promising projects get off the ground. Together, these tools enable the social, economic and political success we enjoy today.

But, as much as technology plays an important role in facilitating the operation of a smart city, deploying every novel gadget across your municipal infrastructure isn’t smart at all.

What smart cities do is create platforms for the community to organise, find new ideas, test them, and create positive changes in their neighbourhood. Smart cities go to their citizens for input, apply agile methodologies and create new models of sustainability and scalability.

That’s what a smart city does, and that’s what makes it smart. The world is full of living examples, too – from Barcelona to San Francisco, from London to Sydney.<sup>[1](https://www.digitalpulse.pwc.com.au/why-we-need-smart-cities/)</sup>
