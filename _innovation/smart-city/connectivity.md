### Connectivity

LFIT is the Louisville Metro Information Technology project and is a partnership with KentuckyWired, the Commonwealthâ€™s project to connect all 120 counties through middle mile fiber infrastructure. This project will expand our fiber network by over 400% at a third of full costs and will both directly and indirectly improve quality of life in our community. The fiber will be used to improve (and lower the cost of) internet service for residents, support government buildings and services, and reduce the digital divide.

### Sensors

We have partnered with the American Printing House for the Blind to install low power, bluetooth beacons in public buildings, and map these indoor spaces for accessibility and public usage, with all data generated contributed to OpenStreetMap. It is an exciting and innovative opportunity to improve public buildings for all in our community.
