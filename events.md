lede_markdown: The Office of Performance Improvement & Innovation views hackathons
  as a key component of our strategy to not only institutionalize innovation, but
  to connect with our citizens, the tech community and any of our project stakeholders.
  We have an open office hack night, once a month with our local Code for America
  chapter, the non-profit Civic Data Alliance, in addition to a quarterly capstone
  hackathon that encapsulates all of the previous quarter focus areas. Check out some
  of our upcoming events.
