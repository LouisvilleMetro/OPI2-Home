title: Smart City
---

No other city is as hyper-focused on exploring the intersection between the Smart City and the Smart Home. Residents are increasingly relying on technology platforms to receive information and services and expect to access city services that are human-centered and friction-free. In order to prepare for Louisville’s Smart City future, we are making investments in foundational infrastructure and implementing technologies through public-private partnerships.

o LFIT/KentuckyWired(infrastructure)

LFIT is the Louisville Metro Information Technology project and is a partnership with KentuckyWired, the Commonwealth’s project to connect all 120 counties through middle mile fiber infrastructure. This project will expand our fiber network by over 400% at a third of full costs and will both directly and indirectly improve quality of life in our community. The fiber will be used to improve (and lower the cost of) internet service for residents, support government buildings and services, and reduce the digital divide.

Contract award to be named by end of Q4 of 2017, with release of detailed engineering drawings, and bid for the construction by Q1 of 2018.

o AV Drone Project (public safety)

UAS Integration Pilot Program to add UAS capability to our shooting-detection-and-location response. We are building a pilot UAS system that will automatically activate and fly (with obstacle avoidance) to specified coordinates to provide situational awareness after a gun is discharged prior to arrival of the summoned police.

o American Printing House for the Blind, Beacon Project (infrastructure)

We have partnered with the American Printing House for the Blind to install low power, bluetooth beacons in public buildings, and map these indoor spaces for accessibility and public usage, with all data generated contributed to OpenStreetMap. It is an exciting and innovative opportunity to improve public buildings for all in our community.

This technology was recently promoted and demonstrated to an audience from the NewDEAL organization (Developing Exceptional American Leaders), a national network of progressive state and local leaders.
