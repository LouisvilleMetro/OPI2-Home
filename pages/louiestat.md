OPI is the business owner of a performance management program entitled, Louisville Statistics (abbreviated LouieStat). LouieStat brings individual Metro departments before the Mayor and his senior leadership team every six to eight weeks to identify and discuss, through consistent metrics tracking and data analysis, what the department (and Metro Government) can do to continually improve the services it delivers to the citizens of Louisville. In between LouieStat forums, OPI supports the department through management consulting, measurement identification, data analysis, performance reporting, training and coaching. OPI maintains the LouieStat website (www.louiestat.louisvilleky.gov), which communicates each LouieStat departmentâ€™s performance to the public.
